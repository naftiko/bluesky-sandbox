      title: Bluesky Social API
      description: >-
        The Bluesky Social API provides programmatic access to the Bluesky
        social network built on the AT Protocol. This API enables developers
        to:- Manage user profiles and preferences- Create, read, and interact
        with posts and feeds- Handle social graph operations (follows, blocks,
        mutes)- Process notifications and conversations- Moderate content and
        manage labels- Synchronize repository dataAuthentication is handled via
        Bearer tokens. Public endpoints can be accessed directly at
        https://public.api.bsky.app, while authenticated requests should be made
        to the user's Personal Data Server (PDS).For more information, visit the
        [Bluesky API Documentation](https://docs.bsky.app).
