    The Bluesky Social API provides programmatic access to the Bluesky social
    network built on the AT Protocol. 


    This API enables developers to:

    - Manage user profiles and preferences

    - Create, read, and interact with posts and feeds

    - Handle social graph operations (follows, blocks, mutes)

    - Process notifications and conversations

    - Moderate content and manage labels

    - Synchronize repository data


    Authentication is handled via Bearer tokens. Public endpoints can be
    accessed directly at https://public.api.bsky.app, while authenticated
    requests should be made to the user's Personal Data Server (PDS).


    For more information, visit the [Bluesky API
    Documentation](https://docs.bsky.app).

        Upload a new blob, to be referenced from a repository record. The blob
        will be deleted if it is not referenced within a time window (eg,
        minutes). Blob restrictions (mimetype, size, etc) are enforced when the
        reference is created. Requires auth, implemented by PDS.
