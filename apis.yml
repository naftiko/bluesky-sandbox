    description: >-
      The Bluesky Social API provides programmatic access to the Bluesky
      social network built on the AT Protocol. This API enables developers
      to manage user profiles and preferences, create, read, and interact
      with posts and feeds, handle social graph operations (follows, blocks,
      mutes), process notifications and conversations, moderate content and
      manage labels, and synchronize repository data. Authentication is
      handled via Bearer tokens. Public endpoints can be accessed directly at
      https://public.api.bsky.app, while authenticated requests should be made
      to the user's Personal Data Server (PDS). For more information, visit the
      Bluesky API Documentation at https://docs.bsky.app.
